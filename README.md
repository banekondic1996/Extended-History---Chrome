Chrome extension for extended history duration and better history view,<br> and option to store history for more then 90 days.<br>
Originaly made just because of 90 days limit in chromium, <br> instead of rebuilding chromium I made extension. I hope it works...<br>
**Features:**
<pre>
-Filter history by date, url, title
-See time spent on websites and total page loads
-Export and import history and bookmarks
-Export session tabs and see previous sessions
-Quick access to recent history by pressing extension button 
-Change accent colors if you are into that
-Delete history per day, based on filter, or selection
</pre>
**To do:**
<pre>
-Make popup load faster
-Improve bookmarks moving speed within large folders and being able to move bookmark folders
-Maybe remove lazy loading or improve scrolling for history
-Store page even if page didn't load completely
-Upload to store
</pre>
