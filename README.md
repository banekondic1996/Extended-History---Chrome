Chrome extension for extended history duration and better history view,<br> and option to store history for more then 90 days.<br>
Originaly made just because of 90 days limit in chromium, <br> instead of rebuilding chromium I made extension. I hope it works...<br>
**To do:**
-Fix time spent calculation
-Make popup load faster
-Maybe remove lazy loading or improve scrolling for history
-Store page even if page didn't load completely 
-Change this bad logo
-Upload to store
